# WC-DigiClub-Site

## Rules
1. Be kind and school appropriate
2. Don't delete other people's content (Unless you're improving upon it)
3. Make a folder for your files when making or uploading multiple files - this will keep the project nice and organised. Use your name as the folder name.
4. Don't edit the README file.

cd WC-DigiClub-Site
```
4. Make your changes in the text editor of your choice and commit them
